The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to pca-package-example on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgement, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request. Table of contents \u00b6 Contributing Guideline Table of contents How to contribute Reporting bugs Before submitting a bug report How do I submit a bug report? Suggesting enhancements Before submitting an enhancement suggestion How do I submit an Enhancement suggestion? Contributing to the code Local development Local testing Pull requests How to contribute \u00b6 Reporting bugs \u00b6 This section guides you through submitting a bug report for pca-package-example . Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports. Before submitting a bug report \u00b6 ... check that your issue does not already exist in the issue tracker . Note: If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one. How do I submit a bug report? \u00b6 Bugs are tracked on the issue tracker where you can create a new one and provide the following information by filling in the bug report template . Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem: Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem. Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps to reproduce the issue . Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy-paste-able snippets, which you use in those examples. Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior. Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why. Provide more context by answering these questions: Did the problem start happening recently (e.g. after updating to a new version of pca-package-example ) or was this always a problem? If the problem started happening recently, can you reproduce the problem in an older version of pca-package-example ? What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? Can you reliably reproduce the issue? If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens. Include details about your configuration and environment: Which version of pca-package-example are you using? You can get the exact version by running poetry version in the library repository. Which Python version pca-package-example has been installed for? Execute the python -V to get the information. What's the name and version of the OS you're using ? Suggesting enhancements \u00b6 This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for pca-package-example , including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion and find related suggestions. Before submitting an enhancement suggestion \u00b6 Check the FAQs for a list of common questions and problems. Check that your idea of the enhancement does not already exist in the issue tracker . How do I submit an Enhancement suggestion? \u00b6 Enhancement suggestions are tracked on the issue tracker where you can create a new one and provide the following information: Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion. Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible. Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps . Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why. Contributing to the code \u00b6 Local development \u00b6 You will first need to ensure you have all the tools of the dev environment installed to start contributing on the pca-package-example codebase: git poetry cookiecutter Python with 3.7 , 3.8 , 3.9 & 3.10 versions PyPy3.x Then, clone the repository using git and place yourself in its directory: git clone git@github.com:pcah/pca-package-example.git cd pca-package-example Now, you will need to install the required dependencies for pca-package-example : poetry install -E dev -E test -E docs Then, ensure that project's test suite is passing: poetry run tox To change your python version, use poetry 's environment management . Local testing \u00b6 To run the whole test suite, use: poetry run tox To run the test suite under specific development environment, use: poetry run tox -e VERSION where VERSION becomes one of the py310|py39|py38|py37|pypy3 (for details, check tox.ini ). To check code styling rules, run linters: poetry run pre-commit run -a pca-package-example uses the black coding formatter, and you must ensure that your code follows it. If not, the CI will fail and your Pull Request will not be merged. Similarly, the import statements are sorted with isort and special care must be taken to respect it. If you don't, the CI will fail as well. Python code style is guarded with flake8 . Documentation style is guarded with markdownlint . Both of them will fail your build, if you don't follow their rules. To make sure that you don't accidentally commit code that does not follow the coding style, you can install a pre-commit hook that will check that everything is in order: poetry run pre-commit install --install-hooks Your code must always be accompanied by corresponding tests, if tests are not present your code will not be merged. Pull requests \u00b6 Fill in the pull request template . Be sure your commit messages respects the commit message template . Be sure that your pull request contains tests that cover the changed or added code. If your changes warrant a documentation change, the pull request must also update the documentation.","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"contributing/#python-clean-architecture","text":"","title":"python-clean-architecture"},{"location":"contributing/#contributing-guideline","text":"First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!
